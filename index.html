   <h2 class="border-heading1">Common issues</h2>
   <div class="lists-stuff">
   <ul>
     <li><span class="blue">Bot doesn't have permission to mute this user</span> - This bot must be higher a role than the role that person has. </li>
     <li><span class="blue">Application did not respond</span> - I would suggest doing the command with the "!" prefix if that happens. Example: !mute @user 30m spamming</li>
     <li><span class="blue">Ayanami isn't logging the messages</span> - Please make sure she can view and send messages in that channel. And if you didn't already, do /setlog or !setlog to set the channel she logs messages in.</li>
